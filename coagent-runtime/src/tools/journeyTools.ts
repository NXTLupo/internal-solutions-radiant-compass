Based on the symptoms you've described - ${symptoms} - that have been present ${duration}, here's what I'm thinking:

üîç **Symptom Analysis**: These symptoms could have several explanations, ranging from common to less common conditions. The important thing is that you're paying attention to your body.

‚ö° **Urgency Assessment**: ${anxiety_level > 7 || symptoms.toLowerCase().includes('severe') || symptoms.toLowerCase().includes('blood') 
  ? "I recommend scheduling an appointment with your doctor within the next few days to discuss these symptoms."
  : "While not immediately urgent, these symptoms warrant a conversation with your healthcare provider within the next week or two."}

üìù **Next Steps I Recommend**:
1. Keep a simple symptom diary - note when symptoms occur, what triggers them, and how severe they are (1-10 scale)
2. Prepare specific questions for your doctor visit
3. Don't hesitate to advocate for yourself if you feel your concerns aren't being heard

üí≠ **A Gentle Reminder**: Many symptoms have benign explanations, but you deserve to have your concerns taken seriously. Trust your instincts about your body.

**Before Your ${appointment_type} Appointment:**

üìù **Questions to Ask Your Doctor**:
1. "Based on my symptoms (${symptoms}), what are the most likely explanations?"
2. "What tests or evaluations do you recommend to understand what's happening?"
3. "Are there any warning signs I should watch for that would require immediate attention?"
4. "What can I do to manage these symptoms while we figure out the cause?"
5. "When should I follow up with you, and what should I expect next?"

üìä **Information to Bring**:
- List of all current medications and supplements
- Family medical history, especially any similar symptoms
- Timeline of when symptoms started and how they've changed
- Photos or notes about visible symptoms
- Your insurance card and ID

üéØ **How to Advocate for Yourself**:
- If you feel rushed, it's okay to say: "I have a few more important questions"
- If you're not satisfied with "it's probably nothing," ask: "What else should we consider?"
- Request copies of any test results for your records
- Don't leave without understanding the next steps

üí° **After Your Visit**:
- Write down what you discussed while it's fresh in your memory
- Follow through on any recommended tests or follow-ups
- Don't hesitate to call if you have additional questions

Remember: You are the expert on your own body. A good doctor will listen and take your concerns seriously.`;

**Radiant Compass ‚Äì AI-Powered Patient & Caregiver Web App
Comprehensive Product Development Plan (v1.0)**

---

### 1. North-Star Vision

Build the ‚ÄúGPS for rare disease care‚Äù: a secure, responsive web platform that turns every diagnosis into a guided path of **clarity, compassion, and choice**. Patients, caregivers, clinicians, and researchers interact through role-based workspaces powered by a proprietary rare-disease knowledge graph and regulatory-grade FHIR data pipeline. The product launches first for rare cancers, then scales to 7 000+ rare conditions.&#x20;

### 8. Rapid-Build Principles for Claude Code

1. **Start with rich type-safe contracts.** Generate GraphQL schema first, then autogenerate TypeScript types for both client & server.
2. **Leverage agentic scaffolding.** Use Claude Code to create end-to-end slices that include React component, GraphQL resolver, and Cypress test in one prompt.
3. **Chunk-wise generation.** For large features (e.g., Insurance Navigator), break into micro-services and ask Claude to output full file trees respecting repository layout, aligning with user preference for entire files.
4. **Embed knowledge-graph context.** Pass graph sub-queries to Claude at runtime for RAG-style explanations‚Äîinclude citations for medical safety.
5. **Prompt design.** Always include persona + chain-of-thought exemplars to steer tone presets; store reusable prompt templates in `/prompts/*.md`.
6. **Guardrails.** Route all LLM calls through an internal gateway with PII/PHI mask-unmask filters and open-source policy engine (Rego) rules.

---

### 9. UX & Design System

* **Brand**: Deep-blue primary (#2C5282) with emerald accents (#38A169) per journey map; round 8 px; soft-shadow elevation.
* **Motion**: Framer Motion; preference-reduces for vestibular users.
* **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.2 AA, keyboard-first navigation, prefers-reduced-motion.
* **Content Tone**: Default ‚ÄúBalanced Calm‚Äù; user can switch per message; outer-circle messages auto-redact sensitive PHI.

### 10. Key Risk Mitigations

| Risk                           | Mitigation                                                                      |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Regulatory delays (510(k))     | Engage advisory board; parallel track predicate device analysis in Q2           |
| PHI leakage in AI outputs      | Two-tier scrubber; RLHF fine-tune on HIPAA toxic spill dataset                  |
| Hospital data-sharing friction | FHIR Bulk-Export connector & SMART-on-FHIR launch to fit existing workflows     |
| Model drift on rare subtypes   | Continual learning loop via federated fine-tune; shadow-deploy new models first |

---

### 11. Success Metrics (18 mo)

* **Patient NPS ‚â• 60**
* **Care plan time-to-clarity ‚Üì 50 %** vs. baseline (survey)
* **Insurance approval cycle time ‚Üì 30 %** for beta cohort
* **Average monthly real-world evidence sales ‚â• \$25 k**
* **1 000 + paying subscribers @ \$18 / mo**

### 12. Immediate Next Steps (Week 0-2)

1. Finalise functional PRD & sprint-0 backlog.
2. Stand-up repo (`radiant-compass/monorepo`) with ESLint, Prettier, Husky hooks.
3. Provision Dev + Staging clusters (AWS EKS) with network policies.
4. Run **Claude Code spike**: ingest sample pathology PDF ‚Üí JSON ‚Üí plain-language card component.
5. Recruit first 10 patient-advisory testers through partner foundations.
